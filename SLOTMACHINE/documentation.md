# Slot Machine Game Documentation

This documentation provides an overview and explanation of the code for a simple slot machine game. The game simulates spinning a slot machine with a specified number of rows and columns, and allows the player to place bets and potentially win prizes based on the symbols that appear on the machine's display.

## Dependencies

The code utilizes the following dependencies:

- `random`: This module is used to generate random values and make random selections.
- `time`: This module is imported but not used in the provided code. It may be used for timing purposes or for future extensions of the game.

## Constants

The code defines the following constants:

- `MAX_LINES`: The maximum number of lines a player can bet on.
- `MAX_BET`: The maximum bet amount a player can place.
- `MIN_BET`: The minimum bet amount a player can place.
- `ROWS`: The number of rows in the slot machine display.
- `COLS`: The number of columns in the slot machine display.

## Data Structures

The code uses the following data structures:

- `symbol_count`: A dictionary that maps symbols to their occurrence count in the slot machine. The symbols and their corresponding counts determine the probability of each symbol appearing on the machine's display.
- `values`: A dictionary that maps symbols to their corresponding values. These values represent the payout for each symbol if the player wins.

## Functions

The code includes several functions to handle different aspects of the game:

### `check_winnings(columns, lines, bet, values)`

This function calculates the player's winnings based on the symbols appearing in each line of the slot machine. It takes the following parameters:

- `columns`: A list of lists representing the slot machine display. Each inner list corresponds to a column and contains the symbols appearing in that column.
- `lines`: The number of lines the player has bet on.
- `bet`: The bet amount placed by the player on each line.
- `values`: A dictionary mapping symbols to their corresponding values.

The function iterates over each line and checks if all symbols in that line match. If a line contains matching symbols, the corresponding payout is calculated by multiplying the value of the symbol by the bet amount. The function returns the total winnings.

### `get_slot_machine_spin(rows, cols, symbols)`

This function generates a random slot machine display. It takes the following parameters:

- `rows`: The number of rows in the slot machine display.
- `cols`: The number of columns in the slot machine display.
- `symbols`: A dictionary mapping symbols to their occurrence counts.

The function creates a list `all_symbols` that contains all the symbols based on their occurrence counts. It then generates the display by randomly selecting symbols from `all_symbols` for each position in the display. The function returns a list of lists representing the slot machine display.

### `print_slot_machine(columns)`

This function prints the slot machine display to the console. It takes the following parameter:

- `columns`: A list of lists representing the slot machine display.

The function iterates over each row of the display and prints the symbols in a formatted manner.

### `deposit()`

This function prompts the player to enter the amount they want to deposit and returns the entered amount as an integer. It performs input validation to ensure that a valid positive number is entered.

### `number_of_lines()`

This function prompts the player to enter the number of lines they want to bet on and returns the entered value as an integer. It performs input validation to ensure that a valid number between 1 and `MAX_LINES` (inclusive) is entered.

### `get_bet()`

This function prompts the player to enter the amount they want to bet on each line and returns the entered amount as an integer. It performs input validation to ensure that a valid number between `MIN_BET` and `MAX_BET` (inclusive) is entered.

### `main()`

This is the main function that orchestrates the gameplay. It calls the `deposit`, `number_of_lines`, and `get_bet` functions to obtain the necessary input from the player. It then checks if the total bet amount exceeds the player's balance and repeats the process until a valid bet amount is entered. Once a valid bet amount is entered, it subtracts the total bet amount from the player's balance, generates a slot machine display using `get_slot_machine_spin`, prints the display using `print_slot_machine`, calculates the winnings using `check_winnings`, adds the winnings to the player's balance, and displays the result.

## Execution

The code includes a call to the `main` function at the end, which initiates the gameplay. When executed, the code prompts the player for the deposit amount, the number of lines to bet on, and the bet amount. It then generates a random slot machine display, calculates the winnings, updates the player's balance, and displays the results.

Note: The provided code snippet lacks error handling and does not include a loop for allowing the player to play multiple rounds.
